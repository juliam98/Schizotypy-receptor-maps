# Schizotypy-receptor-maps
## Aims
This repository contains code and data used in the analysis of ASL-MRI data from high and low schizotypy individuals. 

Six publically-available receptor density/ molecular atlases were used to correlate regional rCBF associated with [O-LIFE](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16417985/) scores. The aim of this analysis is to investigate the contribution of those six receptors (and transporters/vesicles) on changes in neuronal activity associated with schizotypy traits.

## Data analysis process
### The receptor/ molecular maps used in the analysis are:
- D1
- D2
- DAT
- GABAa5
- GABAbz
- mGlu5R
- NMDA
- SV2A
